### Contribute

The story and first draft was written by [rubensz](https://github.com/rubensz), who is also maintaining this repository during development, but anybody is welcome to clone the script for the purpose of tinkering, edit, correct, comment, improve and push the “code” back to the repository – just like with open source software.

Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/b24679402957c63ec426) for details on submitting pull requests to the head writer.

### Versioning

We use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning as a source of inspiration for best practice. I hope create a versioning scheme for screenplays in the future.

### Prerequisites

##### Fountain Syntax

This script is written in a Fountain which is a plain text markdown language for screenplays. As long as you follow the Fountain Syntax, you can edit the screenplay in any editor for plain text – although software dedicated to Fountain syntax (or one with a plugin for Fountain), gives a superior writing experience. To see some options, see this [link](https://fountain.io/apps).

##### Git

Git is software for version control. Follow [these instructions](https://gist.github.com/derhuerst/1b15ff4652a867391f03) on how to install Git on OS X, Windows and Linux
